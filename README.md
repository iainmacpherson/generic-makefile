# generic-makefile
This is my generic Makefile for small C/C++ projects. Useful when you want to quickly build something that is more than a couple of files and you don't want to go to the effort of setting up a more involved build system.

## Usage
1. Place the Makefile in the root of your project folder.
2. Put your source files in a directory called src.
3. Run `make` to build. (You will find the newly created binary in the "build" directory, if it does not exist it will be created)
4. Edit Makefile as necessary for the application.
